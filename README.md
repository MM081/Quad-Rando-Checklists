# Quad-Rando-Checklists
Checklists for the Quad Randomizer + OoTR

I don't like that most trackers use location names like "Compass Chest" and "Map Chest," so I wrote this up to have names that you can (hopefully) understand even if you've never played the games before. It also tells you if a check requires the Lamp, Fire Rod, or Magic Mirror, as a little bonus. 
Currently only has A Link to the Past.

Get the Quad Randomizer [here](https://quad.beta.samus.link/)

Get OoTR [here](https://ootrandomizer.com/)

TO DO:

Find a way to keep the boxes checked after closing the tab

Redo some location names, such as "Big Room Small Chest" and the entirety of Skull Woods

Finish the rest of the lists (Obviously)
