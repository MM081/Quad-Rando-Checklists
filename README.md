# Quad-Rando-Checklists
Checklists for the Quad Randomizer + OoTR

I don't like that most trackers use location names like "Compass Chest" and "Map Chest" so I wrote this up to have names that you can (hopefully) understand even if you've never played the games before.
It's far from done, and currently only has a list for A Link to the Past. It also doesn't keep track of what's been checked off after closing the page, so be wary of that until I find a solution. And Skull Woods needs better location names, I have no clue what to name them.
